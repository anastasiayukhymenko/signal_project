We didn’t write tests for the com.cardio_generator.HealthDataSimulator class because it just simulates random data and
was given to us at the start of the project. We didn’t change anything in it, so we didn’t find it important to test.

The com.cardio_generator.outputs package has low test coverage, especially for TcpOutputStrategy and WebSocketOutputStrategy.
These involve networking and are harder to test with JUnit, and we haven’t learned how to test that yet.

We also didn’t write a test for the main method.
All other packages and classes have good test coverage.
