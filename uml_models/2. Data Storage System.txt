Data Storage System is designed to store and manage time-stamped patient vitals data 
while enabling efficient retrieval for both real-time monitoring and historical analysis. 
Main design components include:  
DataStorage: serves as the central repository, using a patient ID-based mapping system to 
organize records chronologically. It provides methods for adding new data entries, 
retrieving records by patient ID and time range, and deleting outdated records. 
PatientRecord: contains measurement values, types, and precise timestamps.  
AccessControl: enforces permission checks, ensuring only authorized medical staff 
can retrieve sensitive patient data through the DataRetriever.  
DataRetriever: uses storage to fetch records and interacts with AccessControl to 
verify user permissions before data access. This ensures secure retrieval by enforcing access restrictions.
DataDeletion: handles data deletion. It encapsulates policies like removing records older than a specified number of days.
