Data Access Layer represents a health monitoring system, 
responsible for retrieving and processing patient data from external sources such as 
TCP streams, WebSockets, and files. Its main design components include: 
DataListener interface: defines a common contract 
(startListening() and stopListening()) for all types of data sources. 
This abstraction allows the system to remain flexible and easily extendable- new types 
of data sources can be integrated without modifying the rest of the system. 
Three classes- TCPDataListener, WebSocketDataListener, and FileDataListenerâ€”realize this 
interface, each following specific rules or input format. 
DataParser: parses the data collected by listeners. 
It transforms raw input (i.e.: JSON, CSV) into structured PatientRecord objects. 
DataSourceAdapter: acts as a mediator between the parsing logic and the system's internal storage. 
It uses the parser and forwards structured records to DataStorage.
DataStorage: stores patient data in a map and provides methods to retrieve and query it.
