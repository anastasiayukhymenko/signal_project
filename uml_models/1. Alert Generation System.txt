Alert Generation System diagram represents a real-time alert generation system for monitoring patient vitals, using personalized thresholds to trigger alerts when abnormal conditions are detected. Main design components are: 
TresholdValidator: contains validation methods for different alert rules (e.g. “threshold: blood pressure > 100”) and returns a boolean value indicating whether a given condition is met or not. 
AlertGenerator: evaluates patient data against thresholds from TresholdValidator using the DataStorage component to retrieve records. When thresholds are exceeded, it creates Alert objects containing patient ID, condition, and timestamp.
AlertManager: receives and dispatches alerts, ensuring that they are routed to the medical personnel. This decouples the alert handling logic from the core evaluation logic, what improves flexibility of the system. 
DataStorage: maintains a map of Patient objects. 
Patient: contains a list of patientRecords, representing time-stamped measurements.
